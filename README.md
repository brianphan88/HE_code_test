# HE_code_test

## Intro
i took a minimalist approach without leveraging too many libraries or frameworks to complete this project. my reasoning for this is to demonstrate my baseline understanding of node, express, js/ts, and the lightweight implementation could be understood by all levels of reviewers. the libs and frameworks i did choose to use are generally recognized by the javascript community. i would have chosen nestjs if i were looking for something more robust and opinionated. i hope you enjoy reviewing my code
